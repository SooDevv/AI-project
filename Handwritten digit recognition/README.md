# Handwritten Digits Recognition

## Android Demo



## Description

The main purpose of this project is to understand and implement with TensorFlow Lite on Android.<br>
The data is MNIST which is a simple computer vision dataset, consisting of images of handwritten digits and labels. which is famous on Deep learning pattern recognition.<br>
The model i used is MLP(Multi layer perceptron) and CNN(Convolution neural networks) and etc

## Environment

- Window10
- Colab
- Python3, Keras, TFLite
- Android Studio 3.0, Gradle 3.1.3

## Data set
